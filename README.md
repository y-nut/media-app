# [Media App VOD](https://github.com/y-nut/media-app)
_Last edited 13.04.2018_

A basic VOD (Video On Demand) single page application based on Angular 5 and Localstorage on Client‚Äôs side and Google Cloud Functions and Javascript (NodeJS) on the server side. 
The root/home page shows a horisontal carousel of movie art images that the user selects to get to the video player. The user can navigate around on the different pages with the following keyboard buttons: Directional, Escape, and Enter.

The video source is the following external JSON file:
<https://sela-test.herokuapp.com/assets/hkzxv.json>

The external JSON file has CORS disabled and therefore it is requested by a Google Cloud Functions Server to get access to the data. 
As you will see in the JSON file, all the video links are linking to the same mp4 video file because the app is a demo app. 
Similarly, the movie art provided by the JSON file are random. For instance, the first movie art link is <http://lorempixel.com/214/317/?t=1> but as you will see upon refreshing the page, the image changes and it takes a long time to load. Therefore, the first couple of movie arts are overwritten by the actual movie art.

## Getting started
When you have finished the steps below, you should have set up a Google Cloud Functions Server and an Angular 5 VOD app. The instructions are given on Linux.

### Prerequisites
#### _Firebase_
The project relies on Firebase as backend. Therefore you have to create a Firebase project in your Firebase Console. Please refer to the Firebase documentation.
You can test locally with ‚Äúfirebase serve ‚Äîonly functions, hosting‚Äù command.

#### _Angular 5_
The framework for the client app is Angular 5. Please follow instructions on how to set up an Angular 5 development environment on Angular.io. Personally I use Visual Studio Code as the editor and Angular 5 extensions for convergent coding style.

### Installing
* Follow instructions on <https://github.com/bfwg/ngx-drag-scroll> to create the "base" root folder for this project. If this has been followed, the project folder will be called ngx-drag-scroll
* Inside of the root ngx-drag-scroll folder, initiate a Firebase project with hosting and functions. Functions should be based on Javascript. The public folder in the firebase.json file should be dist. The dist folder will then be auto generated when giving the command "ng build --prod"

* Download this project's root folder and replace the files and folders defined below.
* Replace the ngx-drag-scroll/demo folder 
* Replace/overwrite the ngx-drag-scroll/package.json file
* Replace/overwrite ngx-drag-scroll/functions/index.js and ngx-drag-scroll/functions/package.json
* In the root ngx-drag-scroll folder, run "npm install"
* In the ngx-drag-scroll/functions folder, run "npm install"
* Run the commands ‚Äúng build ‚Äîprod‚Äù and then ‚Äúfirebase serve‚Äù or "firebase deploy". 

Your root project folder should look like this.

#### _Demo_
You can see a demo of the project here:
<https://test-4a274.firebaseapp.com>

## Running the tests
No tests yet specified.

## Deployment
This project has been deployed with the Firebase hosting service.
Type ‚Äúfirebase deploy‚Äù in the terminal to launch the site. Firebase deployment supports custom domains. Reference to the Firebase documentation. 

### Built With
* Angular 5 - Angular/CLI -v = 1.6.2
* Firebase - Firebase -V = 3.18.2

## Contributing
No CONTRIBUTING.md has been created yet.

## Versioning
There is no versioning tool used (e.g. SemVer).  Only git.

## Authors
* Thomas Thomsen - initial work

* Rotten Tomatoes - <https://www.rottentomatoes.com> - movie art
* Videogular 2 - <https://github.com/videogular/videogular2> - media player

## Further development
The following features could be considered to improve the app
* Creating a login user interface with the Firebase authentication service
* User information
* Storing the data to a Firebase Realtime/Firecloud database instead of Localstorage
* Subtitles and UI language
* Having the movies and movie art stored on Firebase Storage. This, of course, should be done in a completely legal manner üòá
* Directional buttons could be used to forward/backward the movie
* A loading circle until images are ready
* Render on server side
* Payment solution for paid subscription
* The pager on the view list page could be hidden if less than pager items are shown
